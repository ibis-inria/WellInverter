        <h1>Operations on data files</h1>

        <p>WellInverter supports Microsoft Excel XLSX data files generated by Tecan microplate readers.</p>
        <p>When reading a data file, WellInverter uses the following constraints:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only the first worksheet in a Tecan workbook is read.</li>
            <li>Each data table is preceded with the name of the measurement type.</li>
            <li>Only two types of measurement are allowed: absorbance and fluorescence.</li>
            <li>For an absorbance data table, the name of the measurement type before the measures table starts with "abs".</li>
            <li>For a fluorescence data table, the name of the measurement type before the data table starts with "fluo".</li>
            <li>The 1st row of a data table has the following format: the 1st column cell is labelled "Cycle Nr.".
                Subsequent columns are the time points from 1 to the number of time points.</li>
            <li>The 2nd row of a data table has the following format: the 1st column cell is labelled "Temp [Â°C]".
                Subsequent columns contain the temperature at the different time points.</li>
            <li>From the 3rd row onwards, rows have the following format. For odd row numbers, the 1st column cell
                is the name of a Well, ordered from "A1" to "H12", and subsequent columns contain the values of the
                measurement for the well at the different time points. For even row numbers, the 1st column cell
                is "Time[ms]", and subsequent columns contain the different time points, expressed in ms.</li>
        </ul>

            Allowed characters in the name of a Tecan experiment file are:
            <span class="character-class">a-z</span>, <span class="character-class">A-Z</span>, <span class="character-class">0-9</span>,

        <h2>Storage of experimental data</h2>

        <p>
            The data analyzed by means of WellInverter is not stored locally on your computer. You have to upload
            the data to the WellInverter server before starting the analysis. Once an experiment has been uploaded,
            the data contained in the file is stored on the server. All operations carried out on the data
            (<i>e.g.</i>, outlier detection) and the parameters of the analysis (<i>e.g.</i>, half-live of
            fluorescent protein) are also stored on the server.
        </p>
        <p>
            WellInverter uses the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format to store the data associated with an experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            While experiments are stored on the server, they can be downloaded at any time. It is advised to do this on a regular basis, since like in any computer, the hard disk of the WellInverter may crash.

        <h1>Parameters</h1>

        <p>
            There exist various parameters associated with the different analysis steps of an experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            These parameters are grouped in a form.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>To open the parameter form:</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            1. Click on the <i>Parameters</i> node of the current experiment.
        </p>
        <div><img class="p60" src="help-screenshots/parameters.png" alt="Parameters"></div>
        <p> There are three categories of parameters:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Outlier detection.</b>These parameters specify how outliers are detected and eliminated
                from the data set before the analysis. There is one set of
                outlier detection parameters for each type of measurement (typically absorbance and fluorescence).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Default background.</b> You can set a default background level for each type of measurement.
                These default values are overruled when a background well is defined for a given well and measurement type.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Synchronization of wells.</b> The time axis of each of the wells is shifted in such a way that
                the cross correlation between the data in the wells of the microplate is maximized.
                You can specify a maximum value for the shift. Notice that a maximum shift equal to 0
                disables synchronization.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Hovering <i>?</i> button with the mouse displays help for the corresponding parameter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="background-definition-section">

        <h1>Background definition</h1>

        <p><b>To define background levels for a set of wells and for the different types of measurements:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the type of measurement for which you want to define the background, in the <i>Background</i> subtree.</li>
            <li>Select the wells for which you want to define the background: click on a well, a column or row identifier,
                or draw a rectangular selection with the mouse. If a background has already been defined for a selected well,
                it will be replaced.</li>
            <li>Click on the <i>Set background</i> button.</li>
            <li>Click on the well serving as the background for the selected wells.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Once a background has been defined for a well or set of wells, the background definition window appears as follows:
        </p>
        <div><img class="p60" src="help-screenshots/background-definition.png" alt="Background definition"></div>
        <p>
            Background wells are displayed with a green circle. Wells that have a background are displayed with
            the name the background well. For instance, in the above screenshot, well E1 has A1 as background.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>To clear the background definition for a set of wells:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the measurement type in the Experiments tree for which you want to clear the background.</li>
            <li>Select the wells for which you want to clear the background: click on a well, a column name or a
                line name, or draw a rectangular selection.</li>
            <li>Click on the <i>Clear</i> button.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Notice that, if no background has been defined for the wells, the default background specified in the
            <i>Parameters</i> page will be used for background correction.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="outlier-detection-section">

        <h1>Outlier detection</h1>
        <p><b>To detect and remove outliers:</b></p>

        <p>1. Select the type of measurement for which you want to detect outliers, in the <i>Outliers</i> subtree.</p>

        <p>2. Select the well for which you want to detect outliers, by clicking on a well in the graphical representation
                of the microplate, in the lower left corner of the screen</p>

        <div><img class="p80" src="help-screenshots/outlier-detection.png" alt="Outlier detection"></div>

        <p>Next, two methods exist for detecting outliers: a manual and an automated method.</p>

        <p><b>a. To define outliers manually:</b></p>

        <p>3.a Check <i>Show trend</i>, if it is unchecked.</p>

        <p>4.a Uncheck <i>Hide outliers</i>, if it is checked.</p>

        <p>5.a Indicate the trend in the data on the plot by clicking at regular distances.
            This trend serves as a reference for detecting outliers: data points that are farther than a certain
            tolerance removed from the trend are considered outliers. The black diamond-shaped points that indicate
            the trend in the data can be moved by dragging them with the mouse. They can be removed by clicking
            on the plot, in the neighborhood of the point. To add an additional point between two existing points
            indicating the trend, click between these two points, but not close to the segment connecting them
            (otherwise, this operation will remove the nearest black diamond-shaped point), and then drag the
            added point to the desired position.<br>
            Once a trend has been defined the outlier detection window is displayed as follows:
        </p>

        <div><img class="p60" src="help-screenshots/trend.png" alt="Trend"></div>

        <p>
            6.a Set the tolerance in the <i>Tolerance</i> text box. You can also use the upward and downward arrows in the text box
        to change the current tolerance value.</p>

        <p> 7.a Click on the <i>Filter</i> button to remove outliers from data set, that is, the data points
            that lie at a distance larger than the tolerance from the indicated trend.</p>



        <p><b>b. To define outliers automatically:</b></p>
        <p>
            3.b Click on the <i>Detect</i> button. Note that the automated detection of outliers is additive: when this operation
            is applied to a data set from which some outliers have already been removed by the operations in 3.a, these outliers
            are not considered as data points by the automated outlier detection algorithm. The parameters characterizing the
            automated outlier detection algorithm are specified in the <i>Parameters</i> page.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="plot-section">

        <h1>Plots</h1>

        <p>
            <b>To draw a plot of a given measure:</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            1. Click on the <i>Plots</i> node in the experiments tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Select one or several wells for which you want to plot the data or the quantities derived from the data.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Choose the type of measurement and plot the profiles of interest associated with these measurements.
            The profiles may concern the primary or corrected data and the growth rate, promoter activity, and protein
            concentration. Use <i>+</i> and <i>-</i> buttons to add or remove plots.
            The types of measurements are those defined in the uploaded data file.
            The types of profiles that can be plotted depend on the type of measurement.
            Notice that growth rate can only be plotted for absorbance-type measurements and promoter activities and protein
            concentrations are associated with fluorescence-type measurements. (although they also require
            absorbance-type measurements to be computed).

            4. In addition to plotting profiles for individual wells, the mean and the standard error of the mean of
            the selected set of wells can be plotted by checking the corresponding checkboxes.
        </p>

        <h2>Plot color</h2>

        <p>The color of the plotted profiles can be controlled either manually of automatically. With manual
            color control, once a color is selected by clicking in the color palette (see figure below), it is used for plotting
            all subsequently selected wells, until another color or automatic control is selected. With automatic
            color control, WellInverter chooses a new color in the palette for each new plot. Note that color
            control does not apply to plots of the mean and the standard error of the mean of a selected group of wells.
            These profiles always appear in black. </p>
