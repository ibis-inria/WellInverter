# WellInverter, a web application for analyzing reporter gene data

As input, WellInverter reads the primary data file produced by a 96-well microplate reader (Tecan), containing time-series measurements of the absorbance (optical density) as well as the fluorescence and luminescence levels in each well (if available). Various modules exist to analyze the data, in particular for detecting outliers, subtracting background, estimating growth rates, promoter activities and protein concentrations, visualizing expression profiles, synchronizing replicate profiles, etc.
